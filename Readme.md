There are two ways to execute python code:

1. Write the code in the file and pass it to python intepreter:
  
   ```
   $ python GC_content.py
   ```

2. Make the python file executable by putting this line at the beginning of the file:

   ```python
   #!/usr/bin/python

   ```

   and set the x execution bit:

   ```
   chmod a+x GC_content.py
   ```
